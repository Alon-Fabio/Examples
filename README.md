## Playground!!

This is my place to test and try new things in code.
It's very exiting! I started by installing this React app using pnpm (for the first time), and I think hyperlinks are awesome!
It is my hope that I will use this place to improve my skills and maybe even outers.

### Rules

1. Every addition or test must be an independent file or a group of files that can be removed and used in another project.
2. Every addition or test must have a read me file to explain it witch has 'How to use', 'What it's for' and a date.
